# Diabetes Prediction Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview

### Project Title:
Predictive Analytics for Diabetes

### Description:
This project focuses on developing and evaluating deep learning models for predicting diabetes. Utilizing the diabetes.csv dataset, the analysis includes data preprocessing, model construction, and performance evaluation.

## Content

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Explore the diabetes dataset.
- Handle missing values in columns for healthy and non-healthy patients.
- Replace zeros with column averages.
- Combine subsets into a unified DataFrame.
- Split the dataset into a training set (76%) using random_state=1.

### 2. Model Development
- Build a deep learning model with one hidden layer (24 nodes) and an output layer (1 node).
- Compile and train the model.
- Visualize train and validation loss with epochs.

### 3. Model Enhancement
- Repeat the model development with two hidden layers (32 and 16 nodes).

### 4. Results and Analysis
- Identify overfitting epochs and retrain the model.
- Report the test accuracy rate.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive exploration of diabetes prediction through deep learning models. The included steps cover data preparation, model development, and a thorough analysis of results.
